# HotWheelsTrack

Arduino powered 6 lane Hot Wheels race track.

# Hardware Requirements

The program doesn't really rely on too much, but here is what I used:

* 7 LEDs
* 12 Photoresistors 
* 12 11k Ohm Resistors
* 6 Switches
* 2 Push Buttons
* 6 Seven Segment Displays (Common Cathode)
* 6 CD4511BE IC Chips 
* Arduino Mega

# Software Requirements

The software isn't reliant on much, however there are two things to note:

1. I wrote this using PlatformIO & VSCode
2. The program relies on the KickSort library, which can be found through PlatformIO
